- > Working in public means sharing your process and challenges, rather than just the final product.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public#js_content:~:text=Working%20in%20public%20means%20sharing%20your%20process%20and%20challenges,%20rather%20than%20just%20the%20final%20product.))
  - 📝 公开工作，意味着分享进程与挑战，而不仅仅是最终的成品。

- > **Develop your [metacognition](https://nesslabs.com/metacognition).** Sharing your work in public will allow you to reflect and plan your next steps. Instead of just plowing through work, sharing it with people who lack the context you have will force you to think about your approach, strategies, and progress in a deeper way.

- > **Get early feedback.** Many people make the mistake of working behind a closed door then launching or presenting something to the world, expecting everyone to rush and use it. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to improve your work through multiple revisions. Sharing your work in public will allow you to take a more iterative approach, and ensure that what you’re working on answers the need you have identified.

- > **Increase your creativity.** Great ideas are often the result of a network of information in a transparent community. By sharing your ideas, you will increase the likelihood to connect the dots between your ideas and other people’s ideas, thus creating your mini experiment lab with other researchers.
