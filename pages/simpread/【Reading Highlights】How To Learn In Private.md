- > The more realistic phrasing of “Learn In Public” is “Learn More In Public”, by which I’m merely saying most people would benefit from going a little more public than “100% Private”, which is the default for the vast majority of people. In practice, this really only means going from 0% Public to maybe 1% or 5% or 10% or 30% Public, so of course the majority of the time you are still learning in private.

  - 📝 公开学习，更确切的说法是，更加公开地学习。它并不是 100% 地公开，这实际上也无法实现。我们绝大多数时间里，还是在私下学习。只是与 0% 公开学习相比，也许公开一些，5%-30%，对于个人成长会更有帮助。

- > **People over Content**: Follow people over content sources. When you come across a quality blog, podcast, or talk, notice the person behind it and follow what else they do.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=People%20over%20Content:%20Follow%20people%20over%20content%20sources.%20When%20you%20come%20across%20a%20quality%20blog,%20podcast,%20or%20talk,%20notice%20the%20person%20behind%20it%20and%20follow%20what%20else%20they%20do.%20))
  - 📝 关注内容背后的人
  - 📝 不只是现在的博客、播客、视频等内容，图书也是一样。如果喜欢一个作者，应该把他所有的书都找出来读一遍，然后他出一本书，我们就跟读一本。

- > But a **quality person** is likely to be quality for life. You already know you are the average of the X people you spend time with - so curate those people  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=But%20a%20quality%20person%20is%20likely%20to%20be%20quality%20for%20life.%20You%20already%20know%20you%20are%20the%20average%20of%20the%20X%20people%20you%20spend%20time%20with%20-%20so%20curate%20those%20people))
  - 📝 人变质的速度要远小于内容。这也是更多地关注人，而不是内容的一个原因。

- > The expanded form of this is [**Following the Graph**](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1216519772210388992#m) - not only following people, but following the people _they_ follow (the best way to get in their heads), and tracing _back_ work histories and tracing _forward_ new workstreams. Most things are made by only a small set of prime movers and they are usually (by definition) not hard to find.

  - 📝 关注人的升级版：关注圈子——关注你关注的人关注的人，回看他们的著作、并关注他们最新的工作。

- > **Read Good Books Cover To Cover**: Authors spend a lot of time nailing down details in books because of how permanent it is. They also spend a lot of time _organizing_ the structure and relative weight of the content with some educational goal in mind. If you come across a highly recommended book (or just one that starts off very well), do it the justice of going cover-to-cover. You may get bad chapters or sections, but you won’t know til you plow through it. Particularly pay attention to endings, since people often don’t make it to the end but some authors put The Good Stuff at the end  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=Read%20Good%20Books%20Cover%20To%20Cover:%20Authors%20spend%20a%20lot%20of%20time%20nailing%20down%20details%20in%20books%20because%20of%20how%20permanent%20it%20is.%20They%20also%20spend%20a%20lot%20of%20time%20organizing%20the%20structure%20and%20relative%20weight%20of%20the%20content%20with%20some%20educational%20goal%20in%20mind.%20If%20you%20come%20across%20a%20highly%20recommended%20book%20(or%20just%20one%20that%20starts%20off%20very%20well),%20do%20it%20the%20justice%20of%20going%20cover-to-cover.%20You%20may%20get%20bad%20chapters%20or%20sections,%20but%20you%20won%E2%80%99t%20know%20til%20you%20plow%20through%20it.%20Particularly%20pay%20attention%20to%20endings,%20since%20people%20often%20don%E2%80%99t%20make%20it%20to%20the%20end%20but%20some%20authors%20put%20The%20Good%20Stuff%20at%20the%20end))
  - 📝 遇到好书，从头到尾地读：因为作者花了大量的功夫来组织内容的结构，最终书本的结构肯定是带点传播教导性质的。
  - 📝 也许有些章节比较差，但是不读到最后，我们无法明白作者的深意。
  - 📝 有些书，像罗老师的《阅读的方法》，可以随手翻开阅读。按照此处的定义，要么它的组织性很差，要么它是有意为之的。

- > This is especially relevant if you are Intermediate at whatever you’re doing. Think about it: Beginners need tutorials as they give the shortest path to success, Experts just need to tinker and keep up to date, but Intermediates need context and clear explanation of details.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=This%20is%20especially%20relevant%20if%20you%20are%20Intermediate%20at%20whatever%20you%E2%80%99re%20doing.%20Think%20about%20it:%20Beginners%20need%20tutorials%20as%20they%20give%20the%20shortest%20path%20to%20success,%20Experts%20just%20need%20to%20tinker%20and%20keep%20up%20to%20date,%20but%20Intermediates%20need%20context%20and%20clear%20explanation%20of%20details.))
  - 📝 初学者需要快速入门，专家只需要跟进前沿，恰恰是中途者，需要情境，需要对事物细节的理解。
  - 📝 +陈丹青老师对于一流二流三流的说法：我们遵从一流，忽略二流，最终恰好是困居三流，因为，经由二流去一流的路，断了。

- > **Read Source Code**: People often treat the open source movement as “code that I can use for free”, forgetting the premise that it’s also “code that you can freely fork for your needs”. But we are so spoiled that we even forget that it is “code that you can read to learn from masters”.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=Read%20Source%20Code:%20People%20often%20treat%20the%20open%20source%20movement%20as%20%E2%80%9Ccode%20that%20I%20can%20use%20for%20free%E2%80%9D,%20forgetting%20the%20premise%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20also%20%E2%80%9Ccode%20that%20you%20can%20freely%20fork%20for%20your%20needs%E2%80%9D.%20But%20we%20are%20so%20spoiled%20that%20we%20even%20forget%20that%20it%20is%20%E2%80%9Ccode%20that%20you%20can%20read%20to%20learn%20from%20masters%E2%80%9D.%20))
  - 📝 这是对程序员的建议：开源代码并不只是我们可以免费使用的代码，更重要的，它们是大师们写的，我们可以直接学习的范例。

- > As Ryan Florence has noted: [“I get asked all the time ‘how do I level up?’ Read code. Read lots of code.”](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1119628559767654405#m)  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=As%20Ryan%20Florence%20has%20noted:%20%E2%80%9CI%20get%20asked%20all%20the%20time%20%E2%80%98how%20do%20I%20level%20up?%E2%80%99%20Read%20code.%20Read%20lots%20of%20code.%E2%80%9D))
  - 📝 大佬如是说：我们如何提升（写代码的）水平？阅读代码，阅读大量高质量的代码。

- > **Subscribe to Repos and Issues**: Just like there is [a metalanguage behind the language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0T5OSSzxms), behind the code, there is metacode - discussions and attempts on Github Repos and Issues by collaborators, all in the open. If Reading Source Code is reading code-frozen-in-time, then subscribing to repos and issues is reading code-in-motion.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=Subscribe%20to%20Repos%20and%20Issues:%20Just%20like%20there%20is%20a%20metalanguage%20behind%20the%20language,%20behind%20the%20code,%20there%20is%20metacode%20-%20discussions%20and%20attempts%20on%20Github%20Repos%20and%20Issues%20by%20collaborators,%20all%20in%20the%20open.%20If%20Reading%20Source%20Code%20is%20reading%20code-frozen-in-time,%20then%20subscribing%20to%20repos%20and%20issues%20is%20reading%20code-in-motion.))
  - 📝 这还是对程序员的建议，但是对其他行业同样适用：订阅仓库与问题。代码是死的，但是关于它的讨论是活的，从讨论和问题的修复中，我们能学到很多。

- > **Have a Goal**: You will go further if you put more effort learning one thing than to diffuse your efforts learning random assortments of things. You even gain the superpower of having the permission to _ignore_ things if they’re not on-goal for now  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=Have%20a%20Goal:%20You%20will%20go%20further%20if%20you%20put%20more%20effort%20learning%20one%20thing%20than%20to%20diffuse%20your%20efforts%20learning%20random%20assortments%20of%20things.%20You%20even%20gain%20the%20superpower%20of%20having%20the%20permission%20to%20ignore%20things%20if%20they%E2%80%99re%20not%20on-goal%20for%20now))
  - 📝 设定目标，聚焦于目标

- > I’m not saying you have to have a goal at all times. Sometimes undirected learning is fun, and nice, and leads to serendipity.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=I%E2%80%99m%20not%20saying%20you%20have%20to%20have%20a%20goal%20at%20all%20times.%20Sometimes%20undirected%20learning%20is%20fun,%20and%20nice,%20and%20leads%20to%20serendipity.))
  - 📝 有时候无方向的学习是有趣的、很棒的，可能会有意外收获。

- > **Take Notes**: A [syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_valid_argument_forms):

*   There’s no point learning anything if you can’t recall it - or rather, the more you can recall, the more you actually learned
*   There is a natural limit on how much you can recall at any time
*   So you must take notes to learn more than your brain can hold  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=Take%20Notes:%20A%20syllogism:There%E2%80%99s%20no%20point%20learning%20anything%20if%20you%20can%E2%80%99t%20recall%20it%20-%20or%20rather,%20the%20more%20you%20can%20recall,%20the%20more%20you%20actually%20learnedThere%20is%20a%20natural%20limit%20on%20how%20much%20you%20can%20recall%20at%20any%20timeSo%20you%20must%20take%20notes%20to%20learn%20more%20than%20your%20brain%20can%20hold))
  - 📝 记笔记。评估我们学习质量的一点是：学完之后，能够回忆起多少，越多越好。但是回忆总是有限的，这是自然的限制。所以，我们必须记录比大脑能够记住的更多的内容。
  - 📝 +好记性不如烂笔头

- > I have a bias toward digital notes, because search is a superpower. But search is no substitute for **organization**, which at its base form is a tagging system, but at its best is a “minimum spanning taxonomy” of the subject matter.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private#js_content:~:text=I%20have%20a%20bias%20toward%20digital%20notes,%20because%20search%20is%20a%20superpower.%20But%20search%20is%20no%20substitute%20for%20organization,%20which%20at%20its%20base%20form%20is%20a%20tagging%20system,%20but%20at%20its%20best%20is%20a%20%E2%80%9Cminimum%20spanning%20taxonomy%E2%80%9D%20of%20the%20subject%20matter.))
  - 📝 搜索，对于数字笔记是超强的帮助
  - 📝 但是有了搜索，并不意味着我们不需要良好的组织结构了。组织结构的底层是标签系统，系统对重要事物的最细粒度分类做出了划分。

- > **Spaced Repetition**: Of course you can also just try to increase how much you can recall. [Michael Nielsen is famous for making very bombastic claims about the capacity of Long Term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html), but the basic principle is sound: use spaced repetition learning. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is the leader here.

  - 📝 刻意练习，练习很重要，比练习更重要的是刻意，不刻意，再多的练习都是惘然。
  - 📝 刻意练习的简单释义：在能力的边界反复练习
  - 📝 这就像效能与效率。

- > **Pick Up What They Put Down**: I have called this [the Ultimate Hack for Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public-hack), but of course you can also do this in private. Follow up on anything and everything your unknowing mentor says is good, or is yet to be done, or straight up just replicate their work.

  - 📝 拿起你偶像/导师放下的：他们觉得是好的、但是尚未完成的，或者直接复现他们的工作，从头开始。

- > **The Ben Franklin Method**: I’ve read this before, but was recently reminded by [Mike White](https://twitter.com/myquite/status/1215340113468755968#m). The “Ben Franklin” method is shorthand for a [Dissect and Reconstruct](https://observer.com/2016/12/the-benjamin-franklin-method-how-to-actually-be-a-better-writer/) process for training yourself to notice differences in quality between your output and your input. This is why you think your work sucks - your tastes have zoomed far ahead of your abilities. Ira Glass calls this [The Gap](https://jamesclear.com/ira-glass-failure). The Ben Franklin method is a feedback loop for Closing The Gap.

  - 📝 本富兰克林方法。这是一种练习，其目的在于发现我们的输入与输出之间的差距。有时候我们觉得自己很差劲，是因为我们眼高手低了——个人的品味已经被输入提高了，但是动手能力有限。本方法是一个反馈循环，它旨在缩小这种差距。

  - 📝 费曼学习法。与本富兰克林学法类似。

- > **Active over Reactive**: Active Learning is **Pull-based** - You try to do something, find gaps, and go seek out what you need to get it done. Most learning starts out Reactive - you see something new, you learn it. **Push-based**. The problem is the content industry has swung waaaay too far towards drowning you under a deluge of content. Additionally, Reactive Learning isn’t serving your goals - it serves someone else’s. Though part of learning is learning what to learn, and Serendipity is a wonderful thing, **Just-In-Case** learning isn’t very productive. The right mix of learning will probably include more Active Learning, **Just-in-Time**, than is natural or feels comfortable.

  - 📝 主动学习胜于被动学习。
  - 📝 主动学习是拉取式的，从自己出发的学习，六经注我
  - 📝 被动学习是推向式的，向某个热门事物、或者其他人的目标的学习，我注六经。
  - 📝 最后的比较，我看的不是太懂，大概是这样的。被动式学习，just-in-case，是见招拆招的、间断地学习；而主动学习是 just-in-time，它是从心触发的，可持久的学习。

- > **Compare and Contrast Multiple Perspectives**: I find a shocking number of devs cannot objectively hold competing ideas in their head at the same time. They just loudly state their point of view over and over and over again and attack the weakest argument of their opponents.

- > **Distinguish Game vs Metagame**: Much of learning is focused on how to do better at the Game you’re playing, whatever the game is. But the best players recognize that _the rules of the game_ are changing even while it is being played. If they are smart, or passionate, they are also actively involved in _changing the rules of the game_ while they are playing it. If you don’t want to keep “fighting the last war”, and arriving at the top of your game only to have the game change on you, you must also pay attention to how the game is changing while you play it. Often, this takes the form of realizing that there’s a bigger game out there than the one you once thought your whole world.
