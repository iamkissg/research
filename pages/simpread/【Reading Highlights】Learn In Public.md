- > You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people “learn in private”, and lurk. They consume content without creating any themselves.

  - 📝 我想到古代兵法的传承，都是密而不传的。李靖（大唐军神）写本兵书，都是遮遮掩掩的。

- > What you do here is to have **a habit of creating learning exhaust**:

*   Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets.
*   Speak at meetups and conferences.
*   Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. **Avoid** the walled gardens like Slack and Discord (不和) , they’re not public.
*   Make Youtube videos or Twitch (抽搐) streams.
*   Start a newsletter.
*   Draw cartoons ([people](https://code-cartoons.com/) [loooove](https://wizardzines.com/) [cartoons](https://arkwright.github.io/scaling-react-server-side-rendering.html)!).

  - 📝 公开学习可以做的尝试

- > Whatever your thing is, **make the thing you wish you had found** when you were learning. **Don’t judge** your results by “claps” or retweets or stars or upvotes - just talk to yourself from 3 months ago.

- > But chances are that _by far_ the biggest beneficiary of you trying to help past you is _future you_. If others benefit, that’s icing.

  - 📝 公开学习，最大的受益人是未来的自己。如果对他人也有所帮助，那是锦上添花。

- > If you’re tired of creating one-off things, start building a persistent knowledge base that grows over time. [Open Source your Knowledge](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/open-source-knowledge/)! At every step of the way: _Document what you did and the problems you solved._  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/#js_content:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20tired%20of%20creating%20one-off%20things,%20start%20building%20a%20persistent%20knowledge%20base%20that%20grows%20over%20time.%20Open%20Source%20your%20Knowledge!%20At%20every%20step%20of%20the%20way:%20Document%20what%20you%20did%20and%20the%20problems%20you%20solved.))
  - 📝 尝试持续性的知识库，随时间成长。公开知识库：记录一切

- > The subheading (副标题) under this rule would be: **Try your best to be right, but don’t worry when you’re wrong.** Repeatedly. If you feel uncomfortable, or like an impostor (骗子) , good. You’re pushing yourself. Don’t assume you know everything, but try your best anyway, and let the internet correct you when you are inevitably wrong. Wear your noobyness on your sleeve.

  - 📝 争取正确，但是不要担心不正确，你并不是无所不知的。

- > **People think you suck?** Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in detail, why you suck.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/#js_content:~:text=People%20think%20you%20suck?%20Good.%20You%20agree.%20Ask%20them%20to%20explain,%20in%20detail,%20why%20you%20suck.%20))
  - 📝 如果别人觉得很差劲，没事儿，问问他们，差在哪儿。

- > Did I mention that teaching is the best way to learn? **Talk while you code**.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/#js_content:~:text=Did%20I%20mention%20that%20teaching%20is%20the%20best%20way%20to%20learn?%20Talk%20while%20you%20code.))

- > **Because you learn in public.** By teaching you, they teach many. You amplify (放大) them. You have one thing they don’t: a beginner’s mind.

  - 📝 公开学习的一项优点：彻底地打开思维

- > Eventually you run out of mentors, and just solve things on your own. You’re still putting (推杆) out content though.
