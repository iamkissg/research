- > A decision journal helps you learn from past decisions, think through current decisions, and avoid problems before they happen.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=A%20decision%20journal%20helps%20you%20learn%20from%20past%20decisions,%20think%20through%20current%20decisions,%20and%20avoid%20problems%20before%20they%20happen.))
  - 📝 决策日志，帮助我们从过去的决策中学习，对眼下的决策进行深思，从而避免可能的问题。

- > In most organizations [your product is decisions](https://fs.blog/2013/11/your-product-is-decisions/). By and large, your success will be the sum of the decisions you make over your career.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=In%20most%20organizations%20your%20product%20is%20decisions.%20By%20and%20large,%20your%20success%20will%20be%20the%20sum%20of%20the%20decisions%20you%20make%20over%20your%20career.))
  - 📝 在绝大多数组织里，决策就是你的产品，你在职业上做出的决策的总和铸就了你的成功。

- > A decision journal helps you collect accurate and honest feedback on what you were thinking at the time you made the decision.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=A%20decision%20journal%20helps%20you%20collect%20accurate%20and%20honest%20feedback%20on%20what%20you%20were%20thinking%20at%20the%20time%20you%20made%20the%20decision.))
  - 📝 决策日志帮助我们收集：对决策的当时当刻的思考的精准、诚实的反馈

- > The key to understanding the limits to our knowledge (see [**circle of competence**](https://fs.blog/2013/12/mental-model-circle-of-competence/)) is to check the results of our decisions against what we thought was going to happen and why we thought it was going to happen. That feedback loop is incredibly powerful because our minds won’t provide it by themselves.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=The%20key%20to%20understanding%C2%A0the%20limits%20to%20our%C2%A0knowledge%20(see%C2%A0circle%20of%20competence)%20is%20to%20check%20the%20results%20of%20our%20decisions%20against%20what%20we%20thought%20was%20going%20to%20happen%20and%20why%20we%20thought%20it%20was%20going%20to%20happen.%20That%20feedback%20loop%20is%20incredibly%20powerful%20because%20our%20minds%20won%E2%80%99t%20provide%20it%20by%20themselves.))
  - 📝 理解知识局限性的关键在于：决策的结果与预期的差异，以及为什么预期是那样的。反馈循环提供了这一视角。

- > Writing is the process where you realize that you don’t know what you think you know. [[写作]]   ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=Writing%20is%20the%20process%20where%20you%20realize%20that%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%20what%20you%20think%20you%20know.%20))
  - 📝 写作是你意识到你以为你知道的实际并不知道的过程。

- > Whenever you’re making a consequential decision, either individually or as part of a group, you take a moment and write down:

1.  The situation or context
2.  The problem statement or frame
3.  The variables that govern the situation
4.  The complications or complexity as you see it
5.  Alternatives that were seriously considered and why they were not chosen (think: [the work required to have an opinion](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/))
6.  A paragraph explaining the range of outcomes
7.  A paragraph explaining what you expect to happen and the reasoning and actual probabilities you assign to each projected outcome (The degree of confidence matters, a lot.)
8.  The time of day you’re making the decision and how you feel physically and mentally (If you’re tired, for example, write it down.)  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=Whenever%20you%E2%80%99re%20making%20a%20consequential%20decision,%20either%20individually%20or%20as%20part%20of%20a%20group,%20you%20take%20a%20moment%20and%20write%20down:The%20situation%20or%20contextThe%20problem%20statement%20or%20frameThe%20variables%20that%20govern%20the%20situationThe%20complications%20or%20complexity%20as%20you%20see%20itAlternatives%20that%20were%20seriously%20considered%20and%20why%20they%20were%20not%20chosen%20(think:%20the%20work%20required%20to%20have%20an%20opinion)A%20paragraph%20explaining%20the%20range%20of%20outcomesA%20paragraph%20explaining%20what%20you%20expect%20to%20happen%20and%20the%20reasoning%20and%20actual%20probabilities%20you%20assign%20to%20each%20projected%20outcome%20(The%20degree%20of%20confidence%20matters,%20a%20lot.)The%20time%20of%20day%20you%E2%80%99re%20making%20the%20decision%20and%20how%20you%20feel%20physically%20and%20mentally%20(If%20you%E2%80%99re%20tired,%20for%20example,%20write%20it%20down.)))

- > Your decision journal can be tailored to the situation and context. Specific decisions might include trade-offs, second-order effects, weighting criteria, or other relevant factors.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=Your%20decision%20journal%20can%20be%20tailored%20to%20the%20situation%20and%20context.%20Specific%20decisions%20might%20include%20trade-offs,%20second-order%20effects,%20weighting%20criteria,%20or%20other%20relevant%20factors.))
  - 📝 决策日志需要因境制宜，特殊的决策可能需要包含平衡性、二阶影响、权重标准、其他的相关因子

- > We can’t improve our thinking if we can’t see it. Don’t spend too much time on the brief and obvious insights. Often our first thoughts [represent the thinking of someone else](https://fs.blog/2015/08/how-to-think/) and not our own thinking.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=We%20can%E2%80%99t%20improve%20our%20thinking%20if%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20see%20it.%C2%A0Don%E2%80%99t%20spend%20too%20much%20time%20on%20the%20brief%20and%20obvious%20insights.%20Often%20our%20first%20thoughts%20represent%20the%20thinking%20of%20someone%20else%20and%20not%20our%20own%20thinking.))
  - 📝 看不见，就无法思考。
  - 📝 不要花太多时间和精力在主要的显然的洞见上，这是因为我们第一思维通常代表了其他人的思考而不是自己的。

- > Any decision you’re journaling is inherently complex and may involve non-linear systems.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=Any%20decision%20you%E2%80%99re%20journaling%20is%20inherently%20complex%20and%20may%20involve%20non-linear%20systems.))
  - 📝 你的每一次决策都是复杂的，可能会带来非线性的变化。

- > It’s hard to remember what we knew at the time and what were thinking. Hindsight makes things far more explainable and changes our story. A decision journal helps combat this by recording what you knew and what you thought at the time.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20hard%20to%20remember%20what%20we%20knew%20at%20the%20time%20and%20what%20were%20thinking.%20Hindsight%20makes%20things%20far%20more%20explainable%20and%20changes%20our%20story.%20A%20decision%20journal%20helps%20combat%20this%20by%20recording%20what%20you%20knew%20and%20what%20you%20thought%20at%20the%20time.))
  - 📝 人是健忘的，我们很难记住当初做出选择时的所见所思。
  - 📝 后见之明（hindsights）会修改故事，让事情变得更加可解释。
  - 📝 决策日志的即时记录，能够对抗后见之明。

- > The words we use are also important. When we use vague terms, we give ourselves wiggle room. If we want to get better at making decisions we can’t give ourselves wiggle room. Be clear. Be direct. Be simple. An 8-year-old should understand what decision you’re making and why.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=The%20words%20we%20use%20are%20also%20important.%20When%20we%20use%20vague%20terms,%20we%20give%20ourselves%20wiggle%20room.%20If%20we%20want%20to%20get%20better%20at%20making%20decisions%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20give%20ourselves%20wiggle%20room.%20Be%20clear.%20Be%20direct.%20Be%20simple.%20An%208-year-old%20should%20understand%20what%20decision%20you%E2%80%99re%20making%20and%20why.))
  - 📝 用词很重要！当我们使用模棱两可的词，我们是在给自己留余地。
  - 📝 为了获得更好的决策力，我们要摒弃模棱两可的词，不给自己回旋的余地。
  - 📝 清晰、直接、简单，要让8岁的孩童都能理解我们将做出的决策以及为什么。

- > A decision journal that sits on the shelf is less useful than one that gets reviewed. Every six months or so pick it up and look at your past decisions, update entries with what actually happened, and spend time thinking about your process.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=A%20decision%20journal%20that%20sits%20on%20the%20shelf%20is%20less%20useful%20than%20one%20that%20gets%20reviewed.%20Every%20six%20months%20or%20so%20pick%20it%20up%20and%20look%20at%20your%20past%20decisions,%20update%20entries%20with%20what%20actually%20happened,%20and%20spend%20time%20thinking%20about%20your%20process.))
  - 📝 无反思，不决策。
  - 📝 定时地回顾之前的决策，更新从那之后实际发生了什么，花点时间思考你的进步。

- > Realizing where you make mistakes, how you make them, what types of decisions you’re bad at, etc., helps you make better decisions going forward. When you start to identify patterns, you can change your decision process to help account for the things you miss.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=Realizing%20where%20you%20make%20mistakes,%20how%20you%20make%20them,%20what%20types%20of%20decisions%20you%E2%80%99re%20bad%20at,%20etc.,%20helps%20you%20make%20better%20decisions%20going%20forward.%20When%20you%20start%20to%20identify%20patterns,%20you%20can%20change%20your%20decision%20process%20to%20help%20account%20for%20the%20things%20you%20miss.))
  - 📝 意识到你犯的错、如何犯错的、你不擅长的决策，将有助于提高我们的决策力。
  - 📝 在练习决策的过程，识别个人的思考决策模式，不断修改完善思考模式。

- > Just because you had a bad outcome doesn’t mean you made a bad decision. You might have made the right decision (which, in our sense, means that used a good process) and still had a bad outcome. We call that a bad break.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=Just%20because%20you%20had%20a%20bad%20outcome%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20mean%20you%20made%20a%20bad%20decision.%C2%A0You%20might%20have%20made%20the%20right%20decision%20(which,%20in%20our%20sense,%20means%20that%20used%20a%20good%20process)%20and%20still%20had%20a%20bad%20outcome.%20We%20call%20that%20a%20bad%20break.))
  - 📝 菩萨畏因、众生畏果。
  - 📝 不好的结果不一定意味着当初的决策就是坏的，中间的因素太多了。我们需要明辨这一点，并有意识地捕捉风险。

- > When you use a decision journal, you’ll discover two things right away. First, you’re right a lot of the time. Second, it’s often for the wrong reasons. Discovering how lucky you are can be somewhat humbling. This is where the learning begins.  ([🌐 摘要链接](https://fs.blog/decision-journal/#js_content:~:text=When%20you%20use%20a%20decision%20journal,%20you%E2%80%99ll%20discover%20two%20things%20right%20away.%20First,%20you%E2%80%99re%20right%20a%20lot%20of%20the%20time.%20Second,%20it%E2%80%99s%20often%20for%20the%20wrong%20reasons.%20Discovering%20how%20lucky%20you%20are%20can%20be%20somewhat%20humbling.%20This%20is%20where%20the%20learning%20begins.))
  - 📝 决策日志告诉我们两点：1、绝大多数时间，我们是对的；2、但是，这通常归因错了。预期的结果如期而至，是因为我们足够幸运，而不是决策多么正确。
